# Capital Budgeting Analysis

## Overview
Capital budgeting is a financial decision-making process that evaluates investment projects based on their profitability and risk. The key metrics used in this analysis are:

1. **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Measures the present value of future cash flows, discounted at a given rate.
2. **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: The discount rate at which the project's NPV is zero.
3. **Payback Period**: The time it takes for an investment to recover its initial cost from net cash flows.

## Project 1: Coffee Shop – Bangalore
- **Initial Investment:** ₹1,00,000
- **Annual Cash Inflows & Outflows:** The business starts with an investment of ₹1,00,000, followed by net positive cash flows over 5 years.
- **Discount Rate:** 8%
- **NPV:** ₹2,76,430 (Positive, meaning the project is profitable)
- **IRR:** 56.30% (Higher than the discount rate, making it a viable investment)
- **Payback Period:** 2.42 years (Indicates that the initial investment is recovered in approximately 2.5 years)

### Conclusion
This project is highly profitable, has a strong IRR, and a quick payback period.

## Project 2: Coffee Shop – Mumbai
- **Initial Investment:** ₹2,00,000 (Higher than Project 1)
- **Annual Cash Inflows & Outflows:** The project starts with an initial investment of ₹2,00,000, followed by net cash inflows each year.
- **Discount Rate:** 8%
- **NPV:** ₹33,907 (Still positive but significantly lower than Project 1)
- **IRR:** 13.79% (Lower compared to Project 1)
- **Payback Period:** 3.57 years (Longer than Project 1, meaning it takes more time to recover the investment)

### Conclusion
This project is still profitable, but it is riskier and has a longer payback period compared to Project 1.
